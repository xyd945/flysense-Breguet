# flysense-Breguet









This Flysense project is aim to create an Android app/IOS app to automate the flying, video/image capturing process (plus file uploading to aws S3 scenarios) to create a image/video analysis solution based on Dji drone and our data platform.

I used Dji SDK and google map sdk, many codes are from Dji. 

The app was developed in Nov, 2017. 

Besides the GSDemo Dji provided, I also added the video recording parts(https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/android-tutorials/index.html) and media manager parts (https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/android-tutorials/MediaManagerDemo.html)

The integrated app is something like this: see below screenshots
